StreamHub is a frontend React application inspired by a streaming / e-commerce platform.
It allows users to browse movies, view details, and manage a personal watchlist.
The project is designed to demonstrate modern React patterns, routing, state management, and UI robustness.

Local poster images with fallback placeholder
Lazy loading & performance-friendly UI
Persistence via localStorage

Tech

Redux Toolkit (global state where needed)
CSS Modules
LocalStorage (mock persistence)

Component-based architecture
